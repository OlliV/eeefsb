- procfs files => sysfs

- Integrate with the cpufreq subsystem:
    - Allow on-demand speed changes (so that when CPU load increases, the
      FSB can automatically be raised).
    - This will let the speed be changed using the standard GNOME CPU applet,
      for instance.
      
- Find a way to disable the (rather annoying) flashing power LED whilst in
  suspend-to-RAM.

- Investigate ways to decrease power consumption during suspend-to-RAM.
    - Add way to turn off the USB clock
