- Convert from procfs => sysfs

- Improve smart stepping
    - It should be possible to get below 990 MHz by changing M term
      Note: Super hybrid engine (Atom BCLK[0:1]) seems to alter PLL N value
            by using some constant coefficients
    - It should be possible to reach 2.0 GHz by altering also PCI PLL divisors
      as it's the video card which seem to hang up due to increasing PCI clock.
      At least I'm told so... this will require some measurements to confirm,
      as I'm also confused with the datasheet of the ICS9LPR426A which doesn't
      seem to be correct for PLL chip on eee PC 901. It seems that coefficients
      given in the datasheet are not correct and there seems to be some other
      minor errors too.

- Integrate with the cpufreq subsystem:
    - Allow on-demand speed changes (so that when CPU load increases, the
      FSB can automatically be raised).
    - This will let the speed be changed using the standard GNOME CPU applet,
      for instance.
      
- Find a way to disable the (rather annoying) flashing power LED whilst in
  suspend-to-RAM.

- Investigate ways to decrease power consumption during suspend-to-RAM.
    - Add way to turn off the USB clock
    - Decrease other clocks or turn them off if possible
