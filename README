The module itself is in the module/ directory.  To build and insert the
module into your kernel:
    cd module
    make
    insmod eeefsb.ko

Note: Kernel has to be loaded with acpi_enforce_resources=lax option and
      it could be necessary to add i2c-i801 into /etc/modules.

Usage:  once the module has been inserted, several files will appear in the
/proc/eeefsb directory:

    cpu_freq    - Set/Read current cpu clock speed (safety limits are set from options.h)
    bus_control - Reading this file will return the current FSB and voltage settings,
                  while writing to this file will change the FSB and voltage.  The
                  format of this file is three integers:
                  <CPU PLL N multiplier>  <CPU PLL M divisor> <PCI PLL M divider>  <CPU voltage>
                  CPU voltage is 0 for "low" and 1 for "high".
    fan_rpm     - The current speed of the fan in revolutions per minute.
    fan_speed   - The current speed (0-100%) the fan is set to.
    fan_manual  - When 0, the embedded controller turns the fan on and off
                  according to the CPU temperature.  When 1, writing to
                  fan_speed will change the speed of the fan;  the embedded
                  controller makes no changes on its own.
    temperature - The temperature of the CPU (in degrees C).

Note that when the fan is in manual mode, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESTROY YOUR CPU!
It appears that the embedded controller will happily allow the temperature to
reach 90C (the CRITICAL temperature of the CPU), at which point a thermal
shutdown will be initiated.  This will turn the fan to 100%, throttle the CPU,
and probably even shutdown the machine.  Your CPU may or may not survive this
treatment...
